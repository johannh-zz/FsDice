FsDice
======

FsDice is an F# library for calculating and simulating dice probabilities,
as found in board games, games of chance, and the like.

It is primarily an educational project.  I'm using it to learn F# and
hopefully provide an educational example.  I've tried this project in
various languages over the years; this is just the F# incarnation.
